# [WGSL] Struct Alignment Proposal

## Goals

* Declare a default set of struct member layout rules which are simple enough to understand so that we do not require explicit `[[offset(N)]]` annotations.
* Layouts work with acceptable performance for all backends.
* Layouts do not require explicit padding in order to compile.
* Struct layouts allow for scalar-into-vector packing.
* More advanced packing rules can be added in the future (post MVP)

## Proposal

The WGSL specification will declare that all types have a natural alignment and size:

| type        | align             | size                                    |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| f32         | 4                 | 4                                       |
| i32         | 4                 | 4                                       |
| u32         | 4                 | 4                                       |
| vec2        | 8                 | 8                                       |
| vec3        | 16                | 12                                      |
| vec4        | 16                | 16                                      |
| mat2x2      | 8                 | 16                                      |
| mat3x2      | 8                 | 24                                      |
| mat4x2      | 8                 | 32                                      |
| mat2x3      | 16                | 32                                      |
| mat3x3      | 16                | 48                                      |
| mat4x3      | 16                | 64                                      |
| mat2x4      | 16                | 32                                      |
| mat3x4      | 16                | 48                                      |
| mat4x4      | 16                | 64                                      |
| struct      | 16                | last element offset + last element size |
| array<T, N> | element alignment | N * element size rounded to element alignment |


> Note: Recall that mat2x3 has 2 column vectors, each of which is vec3.

> Note: Unlike vectors, matrix size have been rounded to alignment, preventing packing. This was to simplify the size rules. Debatable decision.

A matrix is laid out so that a program can form a reference to each of its column
vectors, and that reference (pointer) is like a reference to a regular column vector.
In particular, the column vector must be aligned.

### Structure Layouts

The rules for aligning a struct field:
* Structures themselves are always 16 byte aligned.
* The first field is always at offset 0 of the structure.
* Subsequent fields have an offset that is the next alignment on or after the previous field offset + previous field size. 
* Structures nested inside other structures will be aligned to a 16 bytes, but fields can otherwise be treated as inlined 
  (there's no special rules for padding at the end of a nested structure).  

Example:

```rust
/*            align(16) size(8)  */ struct A {       
/* offset(0)  align(4)  size(4)  */     u: f32;
/* offset(4)  align(4)  size(4)  */     v: f32;
                                    }

/*            align(16) size(88) */ struct B {
/* offset(0)  align(8)  size(8)  */     a: vec2<f32>;
/* offset(8)  align(1)  size(8)         -- alignment padding -- */ 
/* offset(16) align(16) size(12) */     b: vec3<f32>;
/* offset(28) align(4)  size(4)  */     c: f32;
/* offset(32) align(4)  size(4)  */     d: f32;
/* offset(36) align(1)  size(12)        -- alignment padding -- */ 
/* offset(48) align(16) size(8)  */     e: A;
/* offset(56) align(1)  size(8)         -- alignment padding -- */ 
/* offset(64) align(16) size(8)  */     f: A;
/* offset(72) align(8)  size(8)  */     g: vec2<f32>;
/* offset(80) align(8)  size(8)  */     h: vec2<f32>;
                                    }
```

Observe that `c`, packs into end of the `vec3` of `b`.
Note: With the fixed type alignment and sizes of this initial proposal, scalars can be packed into the *end* of a vector, not the front.

Struct members may be annotated with `[[align(n)]]` and / or `[[size(n)]]` attributes.
For MVP, these attributes can be used to verify that the type's layout rules are as expected by the developer ("show your working out").
In the future these attributes could be used to allow custom control of the alignment and size of each member.

> Note: We may wish to also annotate user defined types (`struct`, `type` aliases) with the same attributes. These would affect all uses of the type, but are still overridable with per-member attributes.

### Array Layouts

Arrays take the alignment of their element type.

Element stride (byte offsets between array elements) is equal to the size of the element rounded to a multiple of the element alignment.

The total size of an array is equal to the number of elements multipled by the element stride.

## WGSL translations

This proposal is similar to, but is not the same as `std140` and `std430` - there are differences around sizes of `vec3`s and arrays.

If the backend does not support this layout ruleset natively, there are some simple transformations that can be done on the AST to make it compatible:

### 1. Packing to `vec4`

Given the natural layout rules described above, all field members can be transformed into a sequence of contiguous `vec4`s, without requiring any unaligned vector loads or stores.

Fields that have been packed are accessed by using swizzles.

For example:

```rust
[[block]] struct Uniforms {
    a : vec2<f32>;
    b : f32;
    c : f32;
};

[[binding(0), group(0)]] var<uniform> uniforms : [[access(read)]] Uniforms;

fn foo() -> vec2<f32> {
    return uniforms.a + vec2<f32>(uniforms.b, uniforms.c);
}
```

Can be translated to:

```rust
[[block]] struct Uniforms {
    abc : vec4<f32>;
};

[[binding(0), group(0)]] var<uniform> uniforms : [[access(read)]] Uniforms;

fn foo() -> vec2<f32> {
    return uniforms.abc.xy + vec2<f32>(uniforms.abc.z, uniforms.abc.w); // or just uniforms.abc.xy + uniforms.abc.zw
}
```

#### Beware of NaNs

If floating point types are mixed with integer types, then the remapped type should use an integer component
rather than a floating point component.
That's because NaNs don't have unique representations, and some hardware will normalize a NaN value to a specific
bit pattern.
On such hardware, certain integer bit patterns, if reinterpreted and processed via a floating point value,
will lose their bit representation.

For example, this original structure:
```rust
[[block]] struct Uniforms {
    a : vec2<u32>;
    b : u32;
    c : f32;
};
```

Should be remapped to this structure:

```rust
[[block]] struct Uniforms {
    a : vec4<u32>;
};
```
The fields that were previously floating point would be reinterpreted after loading by
`bitcast<f32>` and before storing via `bitcast<u32>`.


### 2. Removing end-of-struct padding

Certain backends require structures to be padded to a multiple of 16 bytes. This proposal does not have this requirement.

- [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/chap16.html#interfaces-resources-layout): "The Offset decoration of a member must not place it between the end of a structure or an array and the next multiple of the alignment of that structure or array."
- TODO: Others?

To support these backends, structures can be inlined at the WGSL AST level before emission:

```rust
[[block]] struct Inner {
    v3 : vec3<f32>;
};

[[block]] struct Outer {
    inner : Inner;
    // No 16-byte padding!
    outer : f32;
};

[[binding(0), group(0)]] var<uniform> uniforms : [[access(read)]] Outer;

fn foo() -> vec3<f32> {
    return uniforms.inner.v3;
}
```

Can be transformed to:

```rust
[[block]] struct Outer {
    inner_v3 : vec3<f32>;
    // Still no 16-byte padding!
    outer : f32;
};

[[binding(0), group(0)]] var<uniform> uniforms : [[access(read)]] Outer;

fn foo() -> vec3<f32> {
    return uniforms.inner_v3;
}
```

## Future features

We may also wish to allow `[[contiguous]]` attributes on structs to switch all fields to use scalar (`[[align(4)]]`) packing.
